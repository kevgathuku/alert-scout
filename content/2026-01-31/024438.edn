The hard part of learning a language is speaking naturally under pressure. TalkBits lets you have real-time spoken conversations with an AI that acts like a native speaker. You can choose different scenarios (travel, daily life, work, etc.), speak naturally, and the AI responds with natural speech back. The goal is to make it feel like talking to a real person rather than doing lessons. Techwise, it uses realtime speech input, transcription, LLM responses, and tts streaming to keep latency low so the conversation feels fluid. I’m specially interested in feedback about: – Does it feel natural? – Where does the conversation break immersion? – What would make you use this regularly? Happy to answer technical questions too.
