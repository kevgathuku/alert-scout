Since then, I have rewritten Datalevin's rule engine and improved its storage and query engine. This post focuses on why these matter for the broader goal of using a triple store as a single, flexible data substrate. One store, many workloads Our goal is to simplify data storage and access by supporting diverse database use cases and paradigms, because maximal flexibility is the core strength of a triple store. Using one data store for different use cases simplifies and reduces the cost of software development, deployment, and maintenance. Since 2020, we have been working hard toward this goal of building an easy-to-use and versatile database. I am happy to report that, today, in addition to key-value and relational database features, Datalevin also handles graph queries and deductive logic reasoning tasks, with built-in support for full-text search and vector similarity search as well. All these are seamlessly integrated in a compact package that works in both embedded and server modes. This post is a guided tour of the progress made so far in the storage engine, the query engine, and the new rule engine. Triples as the substrate Datalevin stores data as triples: entity, attribute, value (EAV): the smallest, atomic unit of a data item. This uniform representation is the key that lets one engine handle many shapes of data and many ways of asking questions. A triple store can behave like a relational system when your data is tabular, like a graph system when your data is connected, and like a logic system when you define recursive rules. The challenge has always been performance. Triple stores have historically been slower than row/column stores. The rest of this post explains how Datalevin addresses this challenge. Storage Datalevin uses a fast key-value database library as the storage layer. Specifically, the exceptional read performance of LMDB is the foundation of Datalevin's query performance. Datalevin stores triples with nested indices by leveraging LMDB's DUPSORT capability: the head element of a triple is stored once as the key, and the tail elements are stored as a sorted list of values. This reduces storage overhead and alleviates the data redundancy problem inherent in triple stores. To further reduce data redundancy, we built our own LMDB fork, DLMDB, which adds page-level prefix compression to the storage. For DUPSORT, prefix compression is applied to both keys and values, resulting in significant storage savings. We also removed the lesser-used VAE index. For a typical reference-heavy (foreign key) Datalog database, the footprint reduction can be over 40%. Through relentless code optimization, we achieved these savings without incurring excessive read/write overhead. In fact, for the common Datalevin use case of seeking to a key and reading its list of values in full, we obtained a 40% speedup in most cases. The Datalevin query planner relies heavily on online counting and sampling. To facilitate these operations, we added subtree node count maintenance in DLMDB. These order statistics turn counting and sampling operations from O(n) to O(log n), cutting Datalog query planning time in half. This feature was introduced with minimal write overhead. Query engine Datalevin's query planner performs extensive query rewrite passes to optimize performance. For example, predicates are pushed down into index scans so filters execute early rather than after joins; inequality predicates are rewritten into index range scans, and so on. The planner simplifies the query graph by treating stars as meta-nodes, then applies a Selinger-style dynamic programming algorithm with accurate cardinality estimates. Merge scans collapse star-shaped entity access into a single scan, avoiding redundant joins for attributes belonging to the same entity group. More details on these optimizations can be found in the query engine documentation. Even with relatively accurate cardinality estimation, occasional bad plans are unavoidable, particularly for tricky joins that link different entities. To reduce the impact of such cases, the cost-based optimizer now considers hash joins as an alternative when input size is large. We also extended the optimizer's coverage to more complex query clauses, such as or-join. We made the multi-threaded query execution pipeline more robust by handling edge cases in concurrency and adding backpressure. The pipeline now uses its own thread pool to avoid contention with worker thread pools. Other improvements have focused on usability: \"creature-comfort\" features like a :having clause, allowing math expressions in :find, specifying sort variables by indices in :order-by, full boolean search expressions for full-text, and so on. These features reduce the amount of custom code needed for post-processing results, and in-database operations are usually more efficient than equivalent work in application code. Rule engine Datalevin uses rules to bundle a set of query clauses into named, reusable invocations. As rules can call themselves and other rules, this feature enables recursive logic computation and graph navigation. We wrote a new rule engine that leverages the same cost-based optimizer, allowing Datalevin to serve as an efficient graph database and logic reasoner. The rule engine uses semi-naive fixpoint evaluation, applies magic-set rewrites where beneficial, and seeds evaluation from outer query bindings so it starts with relevant candidates instead of a blank slate. In addition, non-recursive rule clauses are inlined into the main query to let the optimizer plan them with index scans and joins. For T-stratified rules, temporal elimination avoids storing unnecessary intermediate results. Detailed information is available in the rule engine documentation. Benchmarks We added two new benchmarks to showcase the progress we have made. Logic workloads: Math Genealogy benchmark The Math Genealogy benchmark focuses entirely on rule resolution. It is a good stress test for recursive Datalog rules. The dataset contains roughly 256,769 dissertations, 256,767 students, and 276,635 advisor-student relationships. There are four queries in this benchmark. Datalevin's rule engine is very fast on these queries: Q1 (14.4 ms), Q2 (330.9 ms), Q3 (269.6 ms), and Q4 (recursive academic ancestry, 2.9 ms). By comparison, Datomic takes over 40 seconds on Q4, and Datascript runs out of memory. This query is difficult because recursive ancestry computes a transitive closure: each new level of ancestors can join with every previously found level, which can quickly create a combinatorial explosion of intermediate tuples. Even if the average branching factor is modest (say b=3–5 advisors per student), intermediate results can grow on the order of b^k at depth k. If those tuples are generated repeatedly across branches, we end up materializing large intermediate relations just to discard most of them later. Why is Q4 so fast in Datalevin? It exploits bound starting points. The semi-naive fixpoint evaluation works off delta relations only, i.e., each iteration only joins newly produced tuples. When a query binds a head argument, the engine also seeds recursion (and, when effective, applies magic-set rewrites) so it only explores the reachable slice of the graph rather than materializing the full closure. Graph workloads: LDBC SNB benchmark Graph workloads are where triple stores should shine, but performance is where dedicated graph databases usually try to defend their turf. The LDBC Social Network Benchmark (SNB) is an industry-standard benchmark for interactive graph queries. We implemented the full workload and included a Neo4j implementation for comparison here. On the SF1 dataset (about 3.2M entities and 17.3M edges), Datalevin is 27x to 620x faster on short interactive queries (pictured above), averaging 48x faster than Neo4j. These short queries are the most commonly encountered workloads in an operational graph database, so performing well on them has significant practical implications. Some of these short queries (IS2 and IS6) involve unbounded graph traversal, such as finding the root post of a comment. Datalevin handles these with a recursive rule. Thanks to the efficiency of our rule engine, graph navigation performance is stellar. On complex queries, Datalevin is about 12% faster overall, with some queries (IC6, IC8, IC11) orders of magnitude faster and a few (IC3, IC5, IC9) slower than Neo4j. I am sure Neo4j is extensively tuned for these queries, as it is one of the authors of this industry-standard benchmark. It is remarkable that Datalevin performs so well on these complex graph queries without any specific tuning. The important observation here is that the same triple store and query engine handle both relational-style joins and graph traversals without needing special cases for either. Towards the future A triple store is a flexible substrate. When paired with a cost-based query optimizer and a modern rule engine, it can span relational, graph, and logical reasoning workloads. It can also expand toward richer document workloads without changing the underlying model. With the current focus on AI systems, a triple store like Datalevin can serve several critical purposes. An AI agent needs a context graph: entities, facts, relations, constraints, and memories that evolve over time. Keeping that context in one integrated store reduces the impedance mismatch between relational tables, graph edges, embeddings, and documents. Datalevin makes retrieval and grounding first-class: full-text and vector search can pull candidate facts, while Datalog queries and rules can verify, connect, and constrain them. It can also support tool use, where the \"tool outputs\" are simply more facts to join and reason over. For example, in a RAG pipeline, vector search retrieves candidate snippets, graph relations link them to entities and events, and rules enforce constraints such as provenance or recency. Datalevin can serve as an agent's memory model, where episodic facts, long-term knowledge, and computed embeddings all live in one place and can be queried together. In that sense, a unified store is to an AI agent what memory is to human cognition: the common ground where different kinds of signals meet to be reasoned over. Even as AI writes more code, a simple and versatile database remains highly AI-friendly. A context-limited LLM model benefits from a coherent data model and a single query language that covers many use cases. Datalog is truly declarative, meaning there are fewer procedural or implementation details for a model to trip over. That translates to less boilerplate, fewer dialects to remember, and fewer quirks in query semantics, making it more likely that the system handles data correctly. In fact, AI wrote all the Datalevin queries used in the LDBC SNB benchmark mentioned above. Although it is still a relatively niche database, the AI composed queries for Datalevin with ease because the query language is inherently simpler. Next steps The recent rule engine rewrite brings us much closer to the 1.0 release milestone. With the addition of high availability, a JSON API, and libraries for other languages, we expect to reach this milestone this year. After six years of continuous research and development, Datalevin would not be in its current hardened state without the experimentation and production deployment efforts of the Clojure community. I truly appreciate everyone who has used Datalevin and made contributions. The future of simplified data storage and access is near, for human and AI developers alike."}, :excerpts []}]
