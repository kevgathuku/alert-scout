Or worse - I'd ask the agent to run them and it would start looping: fix tests, those fail, then it starts \"fixing\" my code so tests pass, or just deletes assertions so they \"pass\". Out of that frustration I built KeelTest - a VS Code extension that generates pytest tests and executes them, got hooked and decided to push this project forward... When tests fail, it tries to figure out why: - Generation error: Attemps to fix it automatically, then tries again - Bug in your source code: flags it and explains what's wrong How it works: - Static analysis to map dependencies, patterns, services to mock. - Generate a plan for each function and what edge cases to cover - Generate those tests - Execute in \"sandbox\" - Self-heal failures or flag source bugs Python + pytest only for now. Alpha stage - not all codebases work reliably. But testing on personal projects and a few production apps at work, it's been consistently decent. Works best on simpler applications, sometimes glitches on monorepos setups. Supports Poetry/UV/plain pip setups. Install from VS Code marketplace: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KeelCode... More detailed writeup how it works: https://keelcode.dev/blog/introducing-keeltest Free tier is 7 tests files/month (current limit is <=300 source LOC). To make it easier to try without signing up, giving away a few API keys (they have shared ~30 test files generation quota): KEY-1: tgai_jHOEgOfpMJ_mrtNgSQ6iKKKXFm1RQ7FJOkI0a7LJiWg KEY-2: tgai_NlSZN-4yRYZ15g5SAbDb0V0DRMfVw-bcEIOuzbycip0 KEY-3: tgai_kiiSIikrBZothZYqQ76V6zNbb2Qv-o6qiZjYZjeaczc KEY-4: tgai_JBfSV_4w-87bZHpJYX0zLQ8kJfFrzas4dzj0vu31K5E Would love your honest feedback where this could go next, and on which setups it failed, how it failed, it has quite verbose debug output at this stage!
