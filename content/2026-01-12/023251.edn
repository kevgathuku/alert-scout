We&aposll do this by implementing the removal of complete rows when a Tetris piece is placed on the board. For example, if we rotate the red piece in the image above and place it in the third position, the two bottom rows should be cleared: The resulting source code from this second blog post in the series can be found here: The Clojure workspace The Python workspace REPL-driven development If you&aposve read part one of the blog series, you already know that all code will be implemented in both Python and Clojure, so let&aposs start with the latter! Clojure has something called a REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) that lets you write code in small steps, while getting quick feedback on whether the code works or not. We&aposll start by creating a clear-rows namespace in the board component: ▾ tetris-polylith\n  ▸ bases\n  ▾ components\n    ▾ board\n      ▾ src\n        clear-rows.clj\n        core.clj\n        interface.clj\n      ▸ test\n    ▸ piece\n  ▸ development\n  ▸ projects\n Where we add a board row: (ns tetrisanalyzer.board.clear-rows)\n\n(def row [1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1])\n In Clojure, we only need to compile the code that has changed. Since we&aposve added a new namespace and a row, we need to send the entire namespace to the REPL, usually via a key-shortcut, to get it compiled to Java bytecode. A complete row contains no empty cells (zeros). We can use the some function to detect the presence of empty cells: (some zero? row) ;; true\n Here at least one empty cell has been found, which means the row is not complete. Let&aposs also test whether we can identify a complete row: (ns tetrisanalyzer.board.clear-rows)\n\n(def row [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1])\n\n(some zero? row) ;; false\n Yes, it seems to work! Now we can create a function from the code: (ns tetrisanalyzer.board.clear-rows)\n\n(defn incomplete-row? [row]\n  (some zero? row))\n\n(comment\n  (incomplete-row? [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1]) ;; true\n  (incomplete-row? [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]) ;; false\n  #__)\n Here I&aposve added a comment block with a couple of calls to the function. From the development environment, we can now call one function at a time and immediately see the result, while the functions don&apost run if we reload the namespace. It&aposs quite common in the Clojure world to leave these comment blocks in production code so that functions can be easily called, while also serving as documentation. We&aposll clean up the comment block and instead add a board so we have something to test against (commas can be omitted): (ns tetrisanalyzer.board.clear-rows)\n\n(defn incomplete-row? [row]\n  (some zero? row))\n\n(def board [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n            [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n            [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]\n            [1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1]\n            [1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]\n            [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]])\n Now we can calculate the rows that should not be removed: (def remaining-rows (filter incomplete-row? board)) ;; ([0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n                                                    ;;  [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n                                                    ;;  [1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1] \n                                                    ;;  [1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1])\n The next step is to create the two empty rows that should replace the removed ones, which we finally put in empty-rows: (def board-width (count (first board)))\n(def board-height (count board))\n(def num-cleared-rows (- board-height (count remaining-rows))) ;; 2\n(def empty-row (vec (repeat board-width 0))) ;; [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n(def empty-rows (repeat num-cleared-rows empty-row)) ;; ([0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0])\n Here&aposs what the board looks like after complete rows have been removed and new empty replacement rows have been added at the beginning: (vec (concat empty-rows remaining-rows)) ;; [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n                                         ;;  [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n                                         ;;  [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n                                         ;;  [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n                                         ;;  [1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1]\n                                         ;;  [1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]]\n The concat function combines the two lists and creates a new list with rows, while vec then converts the list to a vector. Note that both vec and concat return immutable data, which is standard for all data structures in Clojure. Simplify It occurred to me that we can simplify the code somewhat. We&aposll start by making empty-board a bit more readable by adding empty-row: (ns tetrisanalyzer.board.core)\n\n(defn empty-row [width]\n  (vec (repeat width 0)))\n\n(defn empty-board [width height]\n  (vec (repeat height (empty-row width))))\n Then we can replace: (def empty-row (vec (repeat board-width 0)))\n(def empty-rows (repeat num-cleared-rows empty-row))\n With: (def empty-rows (core/empty-board board-width num-cleared-rows))\n Now we can finally use let to combine the different calculation steps into a function: (ns tetrisanalyzer.board.clear-rows\n  (:require [tetrisanalyzer.board.core :as core]))\n\n(defn incomplete-row? [row]\n  (some zero? row))\n\n(defn clear-rows [board]\n  (let [width (count (first board))\n        height (count board)\n        remaining-rows (filter incomplete-row? board)\n        num-cleared-rows (- height (count remaining-rows))\n        empty-rows (core/empty-board width num-cleared-rows)]\n    (vec (concat empty-rows remaining-rows))))\n Since we&aposve already tested all the subexpressions, there&aposs a good chance that the function will work as expected: (clear-rows board)  ;; [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n                    ;;  [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n                    ;;  [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n                    ;;  [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n                    ;;  [1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1]\n                    ;;  [1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]]\n And indeed, it looks correct! We&aposll finish by creating a test in the new namespace clear-rows-test: ▾ tetris-polylith\n  ▸ bases\n  ▾ components\n    ▸ board\n      ▸ src\n      ▾ test\n        clear-rows-test.clj\n        core-test.clj\n    ▸ piece\n  ▸ development\n  ▸ projects\n (ns tetrisanalyzer.board.clear-rows-test\n  (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]\n            [tetrisanalyzer.board.clear-rows :as sut]))\n\n(deftest clear-two-rows\n  (is (= [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n          [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n          [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n          [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n          [1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1]\n          [1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]]\n         (sut/clear-rows [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n                          [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n                          [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]\n                          [1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1]\n                          [1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]\n                          [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]]))))\n When we run the test, it shows green and we can thus move on to the Python implementation. But first, a few words about the workflow. Work faster - in small steps You might have noticed that we implemented the code before writing the test, and that we didn&apost write the entire function in one go. Instead, we introduced one small calculation step at a time, which we only put together into a complete function at the end. This allowed us to adjust the solution as our understanding grew, and we didn&apost need to keep everything in our heads. The brain has its limitations, so it&aposs important that we help it along a bit! In Clojure, only what has changed is compiled, which usually goes lightning fast. This makes you forget that it&aposs actually a compiled language. You can open any file/namespace in the codebase, and execute a function, perhaps from an existing comment block, and immediately get a response back. Gone is the feeling that something stands between you and the code, in the form of waiting for the compiler to be satisfied. It&aposs easy to become addicted to this immediate feedback, and the feeling is very similar to working with your hands, for example, when throwing pottery: Me at the pottery wheel The contact with the clay resembles what you have when working in a REPL, an immediacy that lets you quickly test, adjust, and work toward an intended goal, in real time. The absence of static typing means the compiler only needs to compile the small change that was just made and nothing else, which is a prerequisite for this fast workflow. Quality is achieved by testing the code often and in small steps, in combination with traditional testing and libraries like malli and spec to validate the data. In languages that require more extensive compilation, or lack an advanced REPL, it&aposs very common to start by writing a test, both as a way to drive the code forward and to trigger a compilation of the code. In a language like Clojure, you can move forward in even smaller steps, in a fast and controlled way. Enough about this, and let&aposs switch over to Python instead! Python We&aposll start by trying to get as good a developer experience as possible, similar to what we have in Clojure. There are many good IDEs, but here I&aposll be using PyCharm. Install PyCharm if you haven&apost already. Install IPython, preferably globally. IPython is an alternative to the standard REPL in Python. Configure IPython&aposs config file, and add: c.InteractiveShellApp.exec_lines = [\"%autoreload 2\"]\nc.InteractiveShellApp.extensions = [\"autoreload\"]\nc.TerminalInteractiveShell.confirm_exit = False\n The config file is probably found here: ~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py Start PyCharm and go to PyCharm > Settings > Python > Console > Python Console > Starting script and add: %load_ext autoreload\n%autoreload 2\n%aimport -pydev_umd\n %load_ext autoreload loads the IPython extension autoreload, which allows modules to be reloaded automatically when files change. %autoreload 2 enables automatic reloading of all modules (except those that are excluded) %aimport -pydev_umd excludes pydev_umd from reloading, to remove errors that would otherwise be shown in the REPL. There may be small red markings in the configuration, but these are not real errors and can be ignored. Select View > Tool Windows > Python Console from the menu, which opens a Python Console panel in the lower part of the IDE. A prompt In [1] should now appear instead of >>>, which indicates that it&aposs the IPython REPL running, and not the standard REPL. Then I set up my keyboard shortcuts under Pycharm > Settings... > Keymap > Plugins > Python Community Editor to be able to send code to the REPL in the same way I&aposm used to in Clojure. I&aposve also added ipython>=8.0.0 to pyproject.toml, and ran uv sync --dev to load the library. Much of what&aposs written here comes from this blog post under the heading \"Easy setup\" (thanks David Vujic!). Now it&aposs high time to write some Python code, and we&aposll start by creating the module clear_rows.py:   ▾ components\n    ▾ tetrisanalyzer\n      ▾ board\n        __init__.py\n        clear_rows.py\n        copy.py\n      ▸ piece\n  ▸ test\n Then we add the row: row = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n After which we run the shortcut command to send the entire module to the REPL, so it gets loaded (output from the REPL): In [1]: runfile(&apos/Users/tengstrand/source/tetrisanalyzer/langs/python/tetris-polylith-uv/components/tetrisanalyzer/board/clear_rows.py&apos, wdir=&apos/Users/tengstrand/source/tetrisanalyzer/langs/python/tetris-polylith-uv/components/tetrisanalyzer/board&apos)\n Now we can select row in the editor and send it to the REPL: In [2]: row\nOut[2]: [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n Through the REPL, we now have a convenient way to interact with the compiled code even in Python! Let&aposs translate the following line from Clojure to Python: (some zero? row)\n By adding the following line to clear_rows.py: 0 in row\n Now we can select the line and send it to the REPL, which is an alternative to loading the entire module: In [3]: 0 in row\nOut[3]: True\n Then we change row and test again: row = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n0 in row\n In [4]: 0 in row\nOut[4]: False\n It seems to work! Time to create a function from the code, and test run it: def is_incomplete(row):\n    return 0 in row\n\nrow = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nis_incomplete(row)\n In [5]: is_incomplete(row)\nOut[5]: False\n Then I update row and test again: row = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nis_incomplete(row)\n In [6]: is_incomplete(row)\nOut[6]: True\n It looks like it works! Now we&aposll add a board to the module, so we have something to test against: def is_incomplete(row):\n    return 0 in row\n\n\nboard = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n         [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n         [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n         [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]\n In Clojure we can filter out incomplete rows like this: (filter incomplete-row? board)\n This is written most simply like this in Python: [row for row in board if is_incomplete(row)]\n The statement is a list comprehension that creates a new list by iterating over board and keeping only rows where is_incomplete returns True. Let&aposs test run the expression: In [7]: [row for row in board if is_incomplete(row)]\nOut[7]: \n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]\n It works! Before for we have row, which is what we iterate over: [row for row in board if is_incomplete(row)]\n Python also allows us to do a calculation for each row, which can be exemplified with: [row + [9] for row in board if is_incomplete(row)]\n Which adds 9 to the end of each row: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 9],\n [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9]]\n Let&aposs return to the original version and assign it to remaining_rows: def is_incomplete(row):\n    return 0 in row\n\nboard = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n         [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n         [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n         [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n         [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]\n\nremaining_rows = [row for row in board if is_incomplete(row)]\n Before we continue, let&aposs do the same refactoring of empty_row in core.py as we did in Clojure: def empty_row(width):\n    return [0] * width\n\n\ndef empty_board(width, height):\n    return [empty_row(width) for _ in range(height)]\n We continue by translating this Clojure code: (def width (count (first board)))\n(def height (count board))\n(def remaining-rows (filter incomplete-row? board))\n(def num-cleared-rows (- height (count remaining-rows))) ;; 2\n(def empty-rows (core/empty-board width num-cleared-rows) ;; ([0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0])\n(vec (concat empty-rows remaining-rows)) ;; [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n                                         ;;  [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n                                         ;;  [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n                                         ;;  [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n                                         ;;  [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1]\n                                         ;;  [1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]]\n Till Python: width = len(board[0])\nheight = len(board)\nnum_cleared_rows = height - len(remaining_rows) # 2\nempty_rows = empty_board(width, num_cleared_rows) # [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\nempty_rows + remaining_rows # [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n                            #  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n                            #  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n                            #  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n                            #  [1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1],\n                            #  [1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]\n I&aposve deliberately copied the functional style from Clojure to Python, and as you can see it works excellently in Python too, but with a caveat. Mutability At one point, part of the Clojure code looked like this: (def empty-row (vec (repeat board-width 0)))\n(def empty-rows (repeat num-cleared-rows empty-row)])\n Which I translated to: empty_row = [0 for _ in range(board_width)]\nempty_rows = [empty_row for _ in range(num_cleared_rows)]\n The problem with the Python code is that empty_rows refers to one and the same empty_row, and if the latter is changed, all rows in empty_rows change, which becomes a problem if num_cleared_rows is greater than one. In the new solution, we instead create completely new rows in Python, while in Clojure we can share the same row since it&aposs immutable. The fact that everything is immutable in Clojure is a big advantage when we let data flow through the system, as it prevents data from spreading uncontrollably to other parts further down in the data flow. Putting it together Let&aposs put everything together into a function: from tetrisanalyzer.board.core import empty_board\n\n\ndef is_incomplete(row):\n    return 0 in row\n\n\ndef clear_rows(board):\n    width = len(board[0])\n    height = len(board)\n    remaining_rows = [row for row in board if is_incomplete(row)]\n    num_cleared_rows = height - len(remaining_rows)\n    empty_rows = empty_board(width, num_cleared_rows)\n    return empty_rows + remaining_rows\n Now we can test run it. Note that we&aposve removed board from the source file, but the REPL still remembers it from earlier: clear_rows(board)\n In [8]: clear_rows(board)\nOut[8]: \n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]\n It looks correct! Before we add a test, we need to expose the clear_rows function in the board interface, by updating components/tetrisanalyzer/board/__init__.py (and sending the module to the REPL): from tetrisanalyzer.board.clear_rows import clear_rows\nfrom tetrisanalyzer.board.core import empty_board, set_cell, set_piece\n\n\n__all__ = [\"empty_board\", \"set_cell\", \"set_piece\", \"clear_rows\"]\n Finally, we&aposll add the test test_clear_rows.py to the board component:   ▾ components\n    ▾ tetrisanalyzer\n      ▸ board\n      ▸ piece\n  ▾ test\n    ▾ components\n      ▾ tetrisanalyzer\n        ▾ board\n          __init__.py\n          test_clear_rows.py\n          test_core.py\n        ▸ piece\n from tetrisanalyzer import board\n\n\ndef test_clear_rows():\n    input = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n             [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n             [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n             [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n             [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]\n    \n    expected = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n                [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]\n    \n    assert expected == board.clear_rows(input)\n Now we can run all tests with uv run pytest: ============================================ test session starts ============================================\nplatform darwin -- Python 3.13.11, pytest-9.0.2, pluggy-1.6.0\nrootdir: /Users/tengstrand/source/tetrisanalyzer/langs/python/tetris-polylith-uv\nconfigfile: pyproject.toml\ncollected 3 items\n\ntest/components/tetrisanalyzer/board/test_clear_rows.py .

Summary I&aposve deliberately kept the Python code functional, partly to make it easier to compare with Clojure, but also because I like the simplicity of functional programming. We also learned that we needed to be careful when working with mutable data! The key takeaway: working in smaller steps helps us move faster!
