After spending years on scaling our previous startup’s platform, we built an open-source full-stack TypeScript + MongoDB framework to stop solving the same auth / database / API / cron job implementations every time we created an app, and we didn’t like the idea of using multiple managed platforms for each of these to run our apps either. (Here’s our prior Show HN post for reference: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44902227) At the same time, we were excited by the whole AI app builder boom and realized that the real challenge there is the platform rather than the tool itself. Now we’re making Modelence the first full-stack framework that’s built for coding agents and humans alike: - TypeScript is already great for AI coding because it provides guardrails and catches many errors at build time, so agents can auto-correct - MongoDB eliminates the schema management problem for agents, which is where they fail the most often otherwise (+ works great with TS/Node.js) - Built-in auth, database, cron jobs and else that just works together out of the box means agents only focus on your product logic and don’t fail at trying to set these things up (+ less tokens spent on boilerplate). You can now try the Modelence app builder (based on Claude Agent SDK) by just typing a prompt on our landing page ( https://modelence.com ) - watch a demo video here: https://youtu.be/BPsYvj_nGuE Then you can check it out locally and continue working in your own IDE, while still using Modelence Cloud as your backend, with a dev cloud environment, and later deploy and run on Modelence Cloud with built-in observability around every operation running in your app. We’re also going to add a built-in DevOps agent that lives in the same cloud, knows the framework end-to-end, and will use all this observability data to act on errors, alerts, and incidents - closing the loop, because running in production is much harder than just building. We launched the app builder as a quick start for developers, to demonstrate the framework and Modelence Cloud without having to manually read docs and follow the steps to set up a new app. Our main focus is still the platform itself, since we believe the real challenge in AI coding is the framework and the platform rather than the builder tool itself.
