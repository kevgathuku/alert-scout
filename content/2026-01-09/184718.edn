Every post on the feed( on slop/duck/storytime) you see is streamed and generated just-in-time with HTML and into a Canvas with Gemini 3 Flash. Comments and DMs are bidirectionally linked with a Cloudflare Workers Durable Object which is why they feel so fast. Every generated post is saved into a DO SQLite which is then served into the \"Following\" feed so it can be served quicker. This was inspired by Wikitok, a VSCode Extension I made around brainrot, and another fully generative UI site I made.
