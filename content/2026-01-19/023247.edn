Since launch (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42908061), we've been using it to run AI agents in isolated macOS environments. We needed VMs that could set themselves up, so we built that. Here's what's new in 0.2: *Unattended Setup* – Go from IPSW to a fully configured VM without touching the keyboard. We built a VNC + OCR system that clicks through macOS Setup Assistant automatically. No more manual setup before pushing to a registry:   lume create my-vm --os macos --ipsw latest --unattended tahoe\n You can write custom YAML configs to set up any macOS version your way. *HTTP API + Daemon* – A REST API on port 7777 that runs as a background service. Your scripts and CI pipelines can manage VMs that persist even if your terminal closes:   curl -X POST localhost:7777/lume/vms/my-vm/run -d '{\"noDisplay\": true}'\n *MCP Server* – Native integration with Claude Desktop and AI coding agents. Claude can create, run, and execute commands in VMs directly:   # Add to Claude Desktop config\n  \"lume\": { \"command\": \"lume\", \"args\": [\"serve\", \"--mcp\"] }\n    \n  # Then just ask: \"Create a sandbox VM and run my tests\"\n *Multi-location Storage* – macOS disk space is always tight, so from user feedback we added support for external drives. Add an SSD, move VMs between locations:   lume config storage add external-ssd /Volumes/ExternalSSD/lume\n  lume clone my-vm backup --source-storage default --dest-storage external-ssd\n *Registry Support* – Pull and push VM images from GHCR or GCS. Create a golden image once, share it across your team. We're seeing people use Lume for: - Running Claude Code in an isolated VM (your host stays clean, reset mistakes by cloning) - CI/CD pipelines for Apple platform apps - Automated UI testing across macOS versions - Disposable sandboxes for security research To get started:   /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)\"\n\n  lume create sandbox --os macos --ipsw latest --unattended tahoe\n  lume run sandbox --shared-dir ~/my-project\n Lume is MIT licensed and Apple Silicon only (M1/M2/M3/M4) since it uses Apple's native Virtualization Framework directly—no emulation. Lume runs on EC2 Mac instances and Scaleway if you need cloud infrastructure. We're also working on a managed cloud offering for teams that need macOS compute on demand—if you're interested, reach out. We're actively developing this as part of Cua (https://github.com/trycua/cua), our Computer Use Agent SDK. We'd love your feedback, bug reports, or feature ideas.

I've been an avid fan of Pocket Operators by Teenage Engineering since I found out about them. I even own an EP-133 K.O. II today, which I love. A couple of months ago, Reddit user andiam03 shared a Google Sheet with some drum patterns [1]. I thought it was a very cool way to share and understand beats. During the weekend I coded a basic version of this app I am sharing today. I iterated over it in my free time, and yesterday I felt like I had a pretty good version to share with y'all. It's not meant to be a sequencer but rather a way to experiment with beats and basic sounds, save them, and use them in your songs. It also has a sharing feature with a link. It was built using Tone.js [2], Stimulus [3] and deployed in Render [4] as a static website. I used an LLM to read the Tone.js documentation and generate sounds, since I have no knowledge about sound production, and modified from there. Anyway, hope you like it! I had a blast building it.
