Since launch (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42908061\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42908061</a>), we've been using it to run AI agents in isolated macOS environments. We needed VMs that could set themselves up, so we built that.<p>Here's what's new in 0.2:<p>*Unattended Setup* – Go from IPSW to a fully configured VM without touching the keyboard. We built a VNC + OCR system that clicks through macOS Setup Assistant automatically. No more manual setup before pushing to a registry:<p><pre><code>  lume create my-vm --os macos --ipsw latest --unattended tahoe\n</code></pre>\nYou can write custom YAML configs to set up any macOS version your way.<p>*HTTP API + Daemon* – A REST API on port 7777 that runs as a background service. Your scripts and CI pipelines can manage VMs that persist even if your terminal closes:<p><pre><code>  curl -X POST localhost:7777/lume/vms/my-vm/run -d '{\"noDisplay\": true}'\n</code></pre>\n*MCP Server* – Native integration with Claude Desktop and AI coding agents. Claude can create, run, and execute commands in VMs directly:<p><pre><code>  # Add to Claude Desktop config\n  \"lume\": { \"command\": \"lume\", \"args\": [\"serve\", \"--mcp\"] }\n    \n  # Then just ask: \"Create a sandbox VM and run my tests\"\n</code></pre>\n*Multi-location Storage* – macOS disk space is always tight, so from user feedback we added support for external drives. Add an SSD, move VMs between locations:<p><pre><code>  lume config storage add external-ssd /Volumes/ExternalSSD/lume\n  lume clone my-vm backup --source-storage default --dest-storage external-ssd\n</code></pre>\n*Registry Support* – Pull and push VM images from GHCR or GCS. Create a golden image once, share it across your team.<p>We're seeing people use Lume for:\n- Running Claude Code in an isolated VM (your host stays clean, reset mistakes by cloning)\n- CI/CD pipelines for Apple platform apps\n- Automated UI testing across macOS versions\n- Disposable sandboxes for security research<p>To get started:<p><pre><code>  /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)\"\n\n  lume create sandbox --os macos --ipsw latest --unattended tahoe\n  lume run sandbox --shared-dir ~/my-project\n</code></pre>\nLume is MIT licensed and Apple Silicon only (M1/M2/M3/M4) since it uses Apple's native Virtualization Framework directly—no emulation.<p>Lume runs on EC2 Mac instances and Scaleway if you need cloud infrastructure. We're also working on a managed cloud offering for teams that need macOS compute on demand—if you're interested, reach out.<p>We're actively developing this as part of Cua (<a href=\"https://github.com/trycua/cua\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/trycua/cua</a>), our Computer Use Agent SDK.

I even own an EP-133 K.O. II today, which I love.<p>A couple of months ago, Reddit user andiam03 shared a Google Sheet with some drum patterns [1]. I thought it was a very cool way to share and understand beats.<p>During the weekend I coded a basic version of this app I am sharing today. I iterated over it in my free time, and yesterday I felt like I had a pretty good version to share with y'all.<p>It's not meant to be a sequencer but rather a way to experiment with beats and basic sounds, save them, and use them in your songs. It also has a sharing feature with a link.<p>It was built using Tone.js [2], Stimulus [3] and deployed in Render [4] as a static website. I used an LLM to read the Tone.js documentation and generate sounds, since I have no knowledge about sound production, and modified from there.<p>Anyway, hope you like it! I had a blast building it.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https://teenage.engineering\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://teenage.engineering</a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GMRWxEqcZGdBzJg52soeVaY7iUSj1YncfIJZIPScBhM/edit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GMRWxEqcZGdBzJg52soe...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://tonejs.github.io</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https://stimulus.hotwired.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://stimulus.hotwired.dev</a><p>[4]: <a href=\"http://render.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://render.com</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46672181\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46672181</a></p>\n<p>Points: 39</p>\n<p># Comments: 11</p>\n"}, :excerpts [{:text "... in Render [4] as a static website.
