A verbose, boilerplate-heavy, object-oriented language. Created during the dot-com bubble by Sun Microsystems. Originally meant for TV remotes, released publicly in 1996. Runs on billions of devices for decades. ▶ Java Philosophy Motto: \"Write once, run everywhere\" Reality: \"Write once, debug everywhere\" Known for long logs, heavy configuration, and legacy systems. ▶ Ecosystem & Influence Inspired JVM languages: Groovy, Clojure, Scala, Kotlin. Also indirectly inspired JavaScript. Failed attempt at the web: Java Applets (thankfully dead). ▶ Enterprise Reality Often paired with Oracle Database. Companies spend years talking about migrating away. Expensive licenses, long-term enterprise lock-in. ▶ Getting Started Pain Install JDK, JRE, JVM. Prepare for massive error logs. Memorize: public static void main(String[] args) ▶ Java Coding Style Forced Object-Oriented Programming. Requires classes even for Hello World. Much more boilerplate than languages like Python. Encourages deep inheritance and complex class hierarchies. ▶ Typical Java Project Lifecycle Write one giant class. Boss complains. Split into deeply nested subclasses. Code becomes impossible to refactor. Developer questions life choices. ▶ Final Truth Java is widely hated yet widely used. Two types of languages: 1) Those people complain about 2) Those nobody uses Love it or hate it, Java gets real work done."}, :excerpts [{:text "JAVA REALITY !!", :matched-terms ["java"], :source :title} {:text "▶ What Java Is ?
