Hover is a Chrome extension that gives you IDE style hover tooltips on any webpage: documentation sites, ChatGPT, Claude, etc. How it works: - When a code block comes into view, the extension detects tokens and sends the code to an LLM (via OpenRouter or custom endpoint) - The LLM generates documentation for tokens worth documenting, which gets cached - On hover, the cached documentation is displayed instantly A few things I wanted to get right: - Website permissions are granular and use Chrome's permission system, so the extension only runs where you allow it - Custom endpoints let you skip OpenRouter entirely – if you're at a company with its own infra, you can point it at AWS Bedrock, Google AI Studio, or whatever you have Built with TypeScript, Vite, and the Chrome extension APIs. Coming to the Chrome Web Store soon. Would love feedback on the onboarding experience and general UX – there were a lot of design decisions I wasn't sure about. Happy to answer questions about the implementation.
