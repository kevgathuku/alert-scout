The goal is to keep pipelines simple and readable, while still supporting early exits and side effects — without introducing monads like Option or Either. Most code uses plain pipe/pipeAsync. For the few cases that need early termination, fp-pack provides a SideEffect-based pipeline that short-circuits safely. I also wrote an “AI agent skills” document to help LLMs generate consistent fp-pack-style code. Feedback, criticism, or questions are very welcome.
